Hello, dear Reader!

This project is dedicated to Exploratory data analysis of admissions data from the Saint Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering for 2022.
The Python code includes the following steps:
- data loading
- data preprocessing
- compiling a report on general information about the admission campaign
- drawing up a portrait of an applicant and comparing portraits of those enrolled on the budget and those who left

This work is my project for the Internship as a Data Analyst at Saint Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering.
